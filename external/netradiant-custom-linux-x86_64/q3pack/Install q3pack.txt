
This is fixed, cleaned and supplemented set of files to map for Q3 and mods.
Place folder contents to baseq3 directory.

shaderlist.txt: make sure to remove/overwrite existing ones
	or remove Q3 shaders names
	(base_*, gothic_*, common, ctf, liquids, models, organics, sfx, skies, skin, tim)
	from other shaderlists (netradiant can handle multiple ones).
Q3 shaders live in single q3shadersCopyForRadiant.shader file here.

Included textures (.jpg, .tga) and sounds are not shipped with the game. Make sure to include used ones with your map!

grabmodels.map is intended for quick preview of Q3 models and ctrl+C->shift+Ving to your map.
