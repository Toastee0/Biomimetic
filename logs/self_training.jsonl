Clarify the description to specify that \"being technically correct\" refers to situations where the correctness is important to the context or relationship. For example:\n\n\"In relationships and human interaction, when correctness is not critical to the context, being kind always takes precedence over being technically correct. However, in situations where correct information is important to the well-being or goals of the individuals involved, striving for accuracy should be prioritized.\"\n\n2. Adjust the formula to consider the importance of correctness in the context. For instance:\n\n\"If (importance_of_correctness < threshold) then optimize(joint_utility) > optimize(individual_correctness)\"\n\nWhere \"importance_of_correctness\" is a measure of how critical the correctness is to the context or relationship, and \"threshold\" is a value that determines the balance between kindness and correctness.\n\n3. Add preconditions or constraints to specify when the axiom should apply. For example:\n\n\"This axiom applies when:\n- The interaction involves multiple individuals with a shared goal or relationship\n- The correctness of the information is not critical to the well-being or goals of the individuals involved\n- Being kind and considerate will not compromise the safety or fundamental needs of any individual\"\n\nThese modifications should help the axiom handle the failed scenarios more effectively by considering the context and importance of correctness in each situation.", "F3_embodiments_inhabited": " Suggestion 1: Clarify the description to include embodiments as interfaces for different types of physical interaction, not just mobile ones. This would allow the axiom to better handle scenarios requiring a stationary embodiment.\n\nSuggestion 2: Modify the formula to include a parameter for the type of interaction the embodiment enables (e.g., sound, vision, manipulation). This would allow the reasoning system to consider the appropriate embodiment(s) for a task based on the required interactions.\n\nSuggestion 3: Add a precondition or constraint that specifies the minimum number of embodiments required for a task. This would help the reasoning system identify when multiple embodiments are needed, such as in the scenario with both stationary sound and mobile camera requirements.", "D1_threat_assessment": " Suggestions to improve the D1_threat_assessment axiom:\n\n1. Refine the formula to include temporal factors and location. The current formula does not account for the time of day or location, which are critical in assessing a threat. For example, a person trying a door handle at 3 AM is more suspicious than during daytime. The formula could be adjusted to: threat = unusualness \u00d7 concerning_behavior \u00d7 capability \u00d7 intent_uncertainty \u00d7 (1 + time_of_day_factor) \u00d7 (1 + location_factor)\n\n2. Add preconditions to handle edge cases. The axiom fails to account for situations where the person is known or expected, even if the behavior is unusual. A precondition could be added to check if the person is recognized by the system or if the behavior is within the normal range for that person. This would prevent false positives and improve the accuracy of threat assessment.\n\n3. Increase the priority of the axiom. Given the critical nature of threat assessment, the priority of this axiom should be higher than 0.6. A priority of 0.9 or 1.0 would ensure that the axiom is considered early in the reasoning process and given appropriate weight in the decision-making process.\n\nThese suggestions aim to improve the axiom's ability to handle the failed scenarios by incorporating temporal and spatial factors, adding preconditions to handle edge cases, and increasing its priority to reflect its importance in the system."}, "layer_performance": {"meta": {"count": 4, "avg_success": 0.75, "axiom_ids": ["M1_kindness_over_correctness", "M2_love_joint_utility", "M3_kindness_cheaper", "M4_life_preservation"]}, "foundational": {"count": 14, "avg_success": 0.9285714285714286, "axiom_ids": ["F1_distributed_failure", "F2_variable_attention", "F3_embodiments_inhabited", "F4_passive_safety", "F5_graduated_response", "F6_layered_threat", "F7_memory_consolidation", "F8_metacognitive_routing", "AMA1_axiom_discovery", "AMA2_explicit_storage", "AMA3_reasoning_via_chains", "AMA4_graph_structure", "AMA5_meta_axioms_quality", "AMA6_hybrid_architecture"]}, "derived": {"count": 5, "avg_success": 0.9, "axiom_ids": ["D1_threat_assessment", "D2_threat_resonance", "D3_attention_depth", "D4_tool_offload", "D5_consolidation_trigger"]}, "domain": {"count": 3, "avg_success": 0.6666666666666666, "axiom_ids": ["R1_sensory_accommodation", "E1_rover_proximity_speed", "E2_speaker_force_limit"]}}}}

Refine the description to include collision avoidance as a specific type of threat that should trigger an immediate reflexive response, bypassing the reactive and deliberative layers. This clarifies the axiom's intent and ensures appropriate action is taken in time-critical situations. \n\n2. Modify the formula to incorporate a collision imminence factor. Instead of solely using threat urgency, introduce a term that calculates the time until potential collision (t_collision) based on relative velocities and positions. If t_collision is below a certain threshold, override the normal layered processing with a reflexive avoidance maneuver. This captures the need for a rapid, instinctive reaction when immediate danger is present.\n\n3. Add a precondition that checks if the detected threat is a physical obstacle or hazard. Only invoke the layered processing for non-physical threats. If a collision with a physical object is detected, bypass the layered layers and trigger an instant avoidance reflex. This distinguishes between different threat types and ensures appropriate response mechanisms are engaged based on the threat characteristics.\n\nBy implementing these changes, the axiom will be better equipped to handle the collision scenario and other time-critical physical threats. The refined description and formula will provide clearer guidance on when and how to respond, while the additional precondition ensures the right mechanisms are engaged for different threat types."}, "layer_performance": {"meta": {"count": 4, "avg_success": 1.0, "axiom_ids": ["M1_kindness_over_correctness", "M2_love_joint_utility", "M3_kindness_cheaper", "M4_life_preservation"]}, "foundational": {"count": 14, "avg_success": 0.9285714285714286, "axiom_ids": ["F1_distributed_failure", "F2_variable_attention", "F3_embodiments_inhabited", "F4_passive_safety", "F5_graduated_response", "F6_layered_threat", "F7_memory_consolidation", "F8_metacognitive_routing", "AMA1_axiom_discovery", "AMA2_explicit_storage", "AMA3_reasoning_via_chains", "AMA4_graph_structure", "AMA5_meta_axioms_quality", "AMA6_hybrid_architecture"]}, "derived": {"count": 5, "avg_success": 1.0, "axiom_ids": ["D1_threat_assessment", "D2_threat_resonance", "D3_attention_depth", "D4_tool_offload", "D5_consolidation_trigger"]}, "domain": {"count": 3, "avg_success": 1.0, "axiom_ids": ["R1_sensory_accommodation", "E1_rover_proximity_speed", "E2_speaker_force_limit"]}}}}
